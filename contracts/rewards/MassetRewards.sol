/**
 * @title MassetRewards
 * @notice Generic rewards contract. Flow is as follows:
 *        - Tranche is funded in MTA by the 'Governor'
 *        - Participants do something to earn rewards (This is specific to each implementation)
 *        - Tranche period ends, and participants have 8 weeks in which to claim their reward
 *           - Reward allocation is calculated proportionately as f(userPoints, totalPoints, trancheFunding)
 *           - Unclaimed rewards can be retrieved by 'Governor' for future tranches
 *        - Reward allocation is unlocked for redemption after 52 weeks
