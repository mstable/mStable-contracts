/**
 * @title StakedToken
 * @notice StakedToken is a non-transferrable ERC20 token that allows users to stake and withdraw, earning voting rights.
 * Scaled balance is determined by quests a user completes, and the length of time they keep the raw balance wrapped.
 * Stakers can unstake, after the elapsed cooldown period, and before the end of the unstake window. Users voting/earning
 * power is slashed during this time, and they may face a redemption fee if they leave early.
 * The reason for this unstake window is that this StakedToken acts as a source of insurance value for the mStable system,
 * which can access the funds via the Recollateralisation module, up to the amount defined in `safetyData`.
 * Voting power can be used for a number of things: voting in the mStable DAO/emission dials, boosting rewards, earning
 * rewards here. While a users "balance" is unique to themselves, they can choose to delegate their voting power (which will apply
 * to voting in the mStable DAO and emission dials).
 * @author mStable
 * @dev Only whitelisted contracts can communicate with this contract, in order to avoid having tokenised wrappers that
 * could potentially circumvent our unstaking procedure.
